pythonProjects
==============

This repo is just for my fun hobby plus assignments

This repo has two very small projects which I did as part of my assignment and just as plain hoddy. The projects are complete with test units and proper documentation. Feel free to fork it!! :D 

These might not be the best projects or cool projects but those project mean a lot to me. These projects gave me introduction to programming world; a world with infinite possiblities of fun and anger. Sometimes compilers are an asshole, but I can't really complain about python, they just take everything. :D


BATTLESHIP
==========
So first project is about Battleship game. It is purely text-based game and I'm currently trying to convert the text-based game to graphical game.

Wikipedia explains better about the game than I do. So if you really don't know about the game just google it! 

Some features about the game

1. The game can be multiplayer/single player game
2. The game has auto and manual ship assignment
3. The game can be pause and resumed at any point of time
4. The game can be reloaded from save point of time
5. The game tracks high scores 


Future plan :

1. Add nice graphics
2. Try to convert it to Javascript
3. Online multiplayer (this is very very long term plan!!)



TREEMAP
========

This is just some fun way of showing your folder size. I'm just having some fun with pygame. It uses basic pygame functions like drawing rectangle, tracking mouse movement. This program/application (I'm not ready for any kind of argument yet) will show propotion all folders or files in choosen directory by drawing rectangle area according to their proportion in that directory. 

Some features about the game

1. The files can color coded or not based on users wish
2. Can choose a directory by clicking representing rectangle
3. The file or folder names can be seen by hovering mouse over the rectangle
4. Show statistic of the directory according file type

Right now there is no other future plans!
